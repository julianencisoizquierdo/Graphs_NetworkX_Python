# Graphs_NetworkX_Python


# My first project with Graphs using NetworkX

## Content of the project
This is my first project dealing with Networks. The goal is to use some of the methods of the networkx library (to_dict_of_lists, read_adjlist, draw_networkx...), deal with networks represented in different formats (adjacency lists, edge lists) and analyze some data contained in a network format.


## Instructions
The files used in this project are `G_adjlist.txt`, `G_edgelist.txt` and `chess_graph.txt`.


## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `Graphs_NetworkX_Python.ipynb` notebook and execute each cell sequentially. Ensure that the required datasets are in the correct file paths.


## Dependencies

Please proceed to the installation of the following libraries with the following code:

```
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Installation
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## Usage
You are allowed to view and fork the repository for personal use. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, feel free to reach out.


## Contributing
Although this project is not open-source, I welcome feedback, bug reports, and suggestions. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to send me an email to julian.enciso.izquierdo@gmail.com.
