# Graphs_NetworkX_Python


# My first project with Graphs using NetworkX

## Content of the project
This is my first project dealing with Networks. The goal is to apply common time series concepts (upsampling and downsampling, linear and spinal interpolation, rolling windows and rolling averages, autocorrelation). Additionally, I aim at exploring basic plotting and visualization with the help of the Matplotlib package.


## Instructions
The file used for the analysis is `Sample - Superstore.xls`. This includes 4 years of daily Sales data by customer and category.


## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `Graphs_NetworkX_Python.ipynb` notebook and execute each cell sequentially. Ensure that the required datasets are in the correct file paths.


## Dependencies

Please proceed to the installation of the following libraries with the following code:

```
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Installation
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
